LOW HANGING FRUIT:
SF clipping, Slashing falling off - This one sounds relatively easy.
Trick not on CD

NEEDS RESEARCH:
TCJ not counting against uptime
Ninjustsu usage on CD
GCD loss
Wrong Ninki Usage

IMPROVEMENTS ON EXISTING MODULES:
TrickAttackWindow.js - use enemies module for debuff tracking rather than the current timer implementation
